On a digital & vaguely public medium, journaling feels a bit different. Though when I think about my online presence as it is now, I don't feel like I use social media as it's intended to be used. (perhaps this is an interesting HCI investigation)

Some thoughts that I've been having, as I've made moves to begin putting thoughts online (again). Though I like to think that I'm in some way removed from my social media accounts - the history of my facebook account says otherwise. Just over 10 years ago, I lied about my age to make a facebook profile in middle school. I'd post frequently, more than once every day & with no impulse control - every thought was a status update. Not sure when I realized that obsessively posting is embarassing & annoying but I'm hoping I've become less obnoxious over the years? Facebook was just some platform where I shared (what I thought were) funny thoughts and videos & where asked people to send me elephants on farmville.

I feel tempted to analyze some of the posts I made further, but I prefer leaving the memories there untouched & the experience unexamined to some degree. It feels odd that I'm old enough to be able to look back on myself & psyche a decade ago, but it's clear I've always been aware and anxious of my use of time. Still, it's nice to know my relationship with my sister is still the same.

Wary of oversharing like I had in the early days, I've spent the last several years sort of lurking around on social media. Probably for the better, given the extent to which the collection & use of user data has gotten out of hand, and how use of social media is correlated with greater unhappiness [citation needed]. insert blurb about the dystopian state of tech & user privacy & capitalism & human/societal degredation. Even having disabled my newsfeed with a browser extension to reduce the time I spend on the platform, sometimes I enter 'facebook.com' into my browser when I'm already there to escape boredom & avoid addressing my boredom. Hence, endless scrolling and escapism via consumption. Though I love the surge of corona and quaranteen memes I think it's best that I leave the platform for good.

Who knows what I'm starting here. Maybe in 10 years, this will have been just as laughable as my early days on facebook (not even mentioning myspace or aim or yahoo music). Maybe I'll have to halt this bc it's a bad idea to have anything personal up on the web. Still, I appreciate journaling & I appreciate this alternative platform, where there are no physical page limits and over which I have greater control. Journaling is a practice I've kept on and off since the 3rd or 4th grade and I find that it keeps me sane. A blurb from a physical entry, which is resonating with me now:
> I appreciate how rooted in the present I have to be to journal - I can't speak for days gone by or yet to pass - I can only express what's on my mind now & what I've experienced up until today, in this moment.

In bringing this up, I mean to make the observation that a piece of writing often feels rooted in and representative of my state of mind, at the time of writing - though maybe someone more seasoned would have a different opinion. I wonder what "this moment" even means and about my own conception of time (which certainly I've adopted from others around me). Thinking far enough into the future, a sample of writing over the course of a few days could be considered representative of who I am, what my state of mind is, in this moment.

In any case, I hope that as I continue to add to a growing body of digitized thought & consciousness, expressing myself comes more easily. I hope society doesn't fall completely apart before I begin to live as I imagine I do or will. I hope the format of my website becomes less cookie-cutter & more fitted to my aesthetic, and I hope my aesthetic begins to represent me & my values more than what I've been arbitrarily exposed to via social media and marketing (perhaps this is not really possible). While I continue on this train of thought, I also hope that I move past the attitude I feel I had of complacency and nihilism in my teens and early 20's, in order to rekindle the vibrancy I had as a kid & infuse it with greater meaning and wisdom.
