On a digital & vaguely public medium, journaling feels a bit different. Though when I think about my online presence as it is now, I don't feel like I use social media as it's intended to be used. (perhaps this is an interesting HCI investigation)

Some thoughts that I've been having, as I've made moves to begin putting thoughts online (again). Though I like to think that I'm in some way removed from my social media accounts - the history of my facebook account says otherwise. Just over 10 years ago, I lied about my age to make a facebook profile in middle school. I'd post frequently, more than once every day & with no impulse control - every thought was a status update. Not sure when I realized that obsessively posting is embarassing & annoying but I'm hoping I've become less obnoxious over the years? Facebook was just some platform where I shared (what I thought were) funny thoughts and videos & where asked people to send me elephants on farmville.

I feel tempted to analyze some of the posts I made further, but I prefer leaving the memories there untouched & the experience unexamined to some degree. It feels insane to me that I'm finally old enough to be able to look back on myself & psyche a decade ago, and it's clear I've always been aware and anxious about my use of time. Another thing's pretty much been the same since then - how my sister showers me with attention online & tries to get me to reciprocate.

Wary of oversharing like I had in the early days, I've spent the last several years mostly lurking on social media. Probably for the better, given the extent to which the collection & use of user data has gotten out of hand. insert blurb about the dystopian state of tech & user privacy & capitalism & human/societal degredation. Even having disabled my newsfeed with a browser extension to reduce the time I spend on the platform, sometimes I enter 'facebook.com' into my browser when I'm already there to escape boredom & avoid addressing my boredom. Hence, endless scrolling and escapism via consumption. Though I love the surge of corona and quaranteen memes I think it's best if I move away from it.

Who knows what I'm starting here. Maybe in 10 years, this will have been just as laughable as my early days on facebook (not even mentioning myspace or aim or yahoo music). Maybe I'll have to password protect this bc it's a bad idea to have anything personal up on the web & i'll have begun to receive even more hyper-personalized advertisements, or who knows what. Still, I appreciate journaling & I appreciate this new platform, where there are no physical page limits and over which I have greater control. Journaling is a practice I've kept on and off since the 3rd or 4th grade; since keeping one regularly for the past 3 years, I've learned a few things about myself & writing style. A blurb from a physical entry, which is resonating with me now:
> I appreciate how rooted in the present I have to be to journal - I can't make up for days gone by - I can only express what's on my mind now & what I've experienced up until today, in this moment. I want all my writing to be this way.  

I hope that, as I continue to add to a growing body of digitized thought & consciousness, expressing myself comes more easily. I hope society doesn't fall completely apart before I begin to live as I imagine I do, or how I'd like to looking forward. I hope the format of my website becomes less cookie-cutter & more fitted to my aesthetic, and I hope my aesthetic begins to represent me & my values more than what I've been arbitrarily exposed to through social media or advertisements. While I continue on this train of thought, I also hope that I move past the attitude I feel I had of complacency and nihilism, in my teens and early 20's, in order to rekindle the vibrancy I had as a kid & infuse it with greater meaning and wisdom.
