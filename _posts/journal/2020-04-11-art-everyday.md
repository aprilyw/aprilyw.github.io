## inspiration
in an effort to habituate within myself a disposition towards creation rather than consumption - i'd like to take on the challenge of making 1 piece of art each day. In spirit of the "don't break the chain" method, I'd like to visualise, document, and gamify habit formation here. This is a living document (f0r now until i decide to restructure the site).
