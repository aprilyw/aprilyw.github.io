> Although the size of the step a human being can take in comprehension, innovation, or execution is small in comparison to the over-all size of the step needed to solve a complex problem, human beings nevertheless do solve complex problems. It is the augmentation means that serve to break down a large problem in such a way that the human being can walk through it with his little steps, and it is the structure or organization of these little steps or actions that we discuss as *process hierarchies*.

> each individual develops a certain repertoire of process capabilities from which he selects and adapts those that will compose the processes that he executes. This repertoire is like a tool kit, and just as the mechanic must know what his tools can do and how to use them, so the intellectual worker must know the capabilities of his tools and have good methods, strategies, and rules of thumb for making use of them. All of the process capabilities in the individual’s repertoire rest ultimately upon basic capabilities within him or his artifacts, and the entire repertoire represents an inter-knit, hierarchical structure (which we often call the *repertoire hierarchy*).

> University of California, Berkeley, philosophy professor John Searle writes: [Computers] have, literally ..., no intelligence, no motivation, no autonomy, and no agency. We design them to behave as if they had certain sorts of psychology, but there is no psychological reality to the corresponding processes or behavior. ... [T]he machinery has no beliefs, desires, [or] motivations.[29]

[Edge.org](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11513)
> First, we jump to the conclusion that others’ behaviors reflect their bad motives and poor judgment, attributing conscious choice to behaviors that may have been influenced unconsciously. Second, we assume that our own choices were guided solely by the conscious explanations that we conjure, and reject or ignore the possibility of our own unconscious biases.
> By understanding confabulation we can begin to remedy both faults. We can hold others responsible for their behavior without necessarily impugning their conscious motivations. And, we can hold ourselves more responsible by inspecting our own behavior for its unconscious influences, as unseen as they are unwanted.

defines core and periphery tasks: 
> **Core Tasks**: The tasks that define how good you are at your job. **Periphery Tasks:** The tasks you have to complete to *keep* your job, but that say nothing about your standing in your field.
finally, keep a tally of hours you spend on core tasks.

[Experiments with Time: How to Take Back Your Day from the Grip of Procrastination](https://zapier.com/blog/productivity-experiments/)

[5 Habits for Crafting the Perfect Remote Work Day](https://doist.com/blog/remote-work-habits/?utm_source=doist_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=navigate_remote_work)
1. get an early start
	- plan your morning  [the night before](https://doist.com/blog/how-exceptionally-productive-people-end-the-workday/)  and stick to that plan no matter what. 
	- If a new task comes in that isn’t 100% urgent, designate a time that you’ll work on it uninterrupted or try to delegate the problem solving as much as possible until you have time to deal with it.
2. decide where to work
	- If you still have a hard time finding your flow as to where you’ll work best, keep trying new things. You can’t change your outcomes or find new solutions without trying new things on to see what fits.
3. prioritize tasks
	-  Using concepts like the  [Eisenhower Matrix](https://doist.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-personal-productivity-methods/#eisenhower-matrix)  or  [Eat That Frog](https://doist.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-personal-productivity-methods/#eat-the-frog)  can put your to-do list in perspective and help you identify what should take precedence.
	- If you’re still having a hard time identifying priorities, try working backward by identifying work that’s definitely not a priority. Eliminate those items and assess what’s left. You’ll have fewer things to consider and a more comfortable time deciding what’s necessary.
4. schedule uninterrupted deep work
	- minimize interruptions when you’re looking for a break.
	- Newport suggests setting goals for the amount of time you spend doing deep work every day and keeping a  [running tally](http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/05/10/lab-notes-i-spent-42-hours-last-month-on-the-activity-most-critical-to-my-success/)  as you go. Not only is it motivating to watch your tallies grow, it also makes you more conscious of distractions that can derail your focus. If you let them.
5. maintain work life balance
	- set firm boundaries for yourself and refuse to waver on them. Make it a habit to  [unplug at a specific time each evening](https://doist.com/blog/how-to-leave-work-on-time/) . Force yourself to keep to your schedule. Incorporate a scheduled “off” day into your week to reset. 


> There’s no right answer or secret sauce to being an incredibly productive person. There are just small, deliberate steps you take every day to work towards a place that makes you feel good about what you’ve accomplished and completely guiltless when you unplug for the night.
